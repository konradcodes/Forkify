This is the Final Project from The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann.  
It is a **Recipe Searching Application using Vanilla JS**.  
In this project we use the **MVC Architecture** as well as **Webpack** for bundling everything and **Babel** to convert new JS code into compatible version for older browsers.
